# numc

Description of the full project can be found here https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa21/projects/proj4/

Quick Summary:
The overall goal of this project was to maximize runtime efficiency by taking advantage of algorithmic and physical machine principles. Utilizing temporal and spatial locality, as well as taking advantage of multithreading, we implemented some basic matrix operations used in NumPy. 
Here are some additional methods we used to speed up runtime of these operations:
-repeated squaring
-loop unrolling
-cache blocking
-SIMD instructions

Note:
The actual source code of the project is deleted from the repository due to the 61c honor code.
