# numc

### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 20
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): 40
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>This project had some interesting parts of it. It was interesting to put together algorithmic and hardware optimizations to speed up processing. That is something that I don't do very often in other classes, where we just focus on algorithmic optimizations.  </b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I learned that numpy was a lot more sophisticated than I originally thought it was. Apparently, there is a lot of hardware stuff that can be done to improve runtime on specific operations.  </b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>No. This project was actually pretty good. I would appreciate more thorough local testing as well as better descriptions on how to use simd instructions. I would also appreciate testing that was easier to debug. </b>
